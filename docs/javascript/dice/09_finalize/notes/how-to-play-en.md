This manual is in English, the **Japanese version** is [here](./how-to-play-ja.md).

## About This Game

This game is based on the public domain dice game **Yacht**. Other similar games include **Yahtzee**, **Yatzy** and **Poker dice**. Most of the rules are based on these games, but some changes have been made as [house rules](#about-this-game).
<!--TODO: modify link-->

In this game, you compete against an opponent for the total score. To get points, you need to make a combination using 5 dice. The number of rerolls is limited, and you cannot reuse a combination once selected. Therefore, this game requires both **luck and strategy**.
